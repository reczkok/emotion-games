# Anger elicitation game - project guide

The project was made as part of the Development Workshop classes at AGH university by Tristan Malatyński, Mateusz Król, Bartosz Stokłosa and Bartłommiej Tarcholik.

## 1. Downloading the project

In order to run the project, it needs to be downloaded. There are 2 possible options for that:

1. Clone the repository from Github by using either the git console or a visual UI application like Github Desktop. It can be done by cloning the repository by HTTPS from this link: https://github.com/AGH-Students-Projects/emotion-elicitation-anger.git
2. Download the repository as a ZIP file from Github and unpack it in a folder

## 2. Downloading Unity 3D

To run the project, it's required to have Unity version 2022.3. Project was made using versions 2022.3.23f1 but it's possible to open it using other versions as long as the versions have similar features. 2022.3 LTS versions should all work.

Download Unity by downloading the Unity Hub, creating an account and selecting the proper version in the Installs section on the left navigation menu in Unity Hub. Unity Hub can be downloaded from here: https://unity.com/unity-hub

## 3. Opening the project

To add the project to your Unity Hub, in the Projects section, select "Add" and select the project folder from the location you have downloaded it to. Unity will then create necessary files and open the project after several minutes.

## 4. Running the project

In order to run the project, it's recommended to run it from Unity. It can also be exported to your desired platform depending on packages selected during Unity installation process.

If any other scene than Main Menu is currently open, select Scenes folder in the project navigation and open the Main Menu scene.

Click Play to play the game, select "Play Maximized" to open the game on maximized screen.

## 5. Running the project in Virtual Reality

In order to run the project in VR, it's required to download the repository from the VR branch instead of the main branch.

There are many possibile options to run the project in VR as different headsets require different ways of connection. To develop the game, Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3 goggles were used. Virtual Desktop app was used for connection through Wi-Fi.

It might be possible to run the game using SteamVR but it's recommended to use something that doesn't rely on Steam, like VDXR. It allows for quick opening of the game into VR from Unity itself.

## 6. Building the project

In order to build the project for use outside of Unity editor, select Build Settings in the File menu, select the proper platform and select "Build" or "Build and Run". The application should create an executable file with supporting folder and file structure. Use that to play the game without usage of the Unity editor.
